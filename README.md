# MobileNet-Model-using-Transfer-Learning

In this Task i have taken use of Haarcascade Face Detection to take a Dataset of our own 'n' number of Photos for Training and testing and saving them accordingly. Then, i Import a Mobile Net Model from imagenet and freezed all its layer to make them untrainable and then i added one new layer at second Last Position, to work on my given dataset of face photos, then i add both the existing model and the new Fully connected layer. Lastly i compiled it and trained it on the datasets by giving a appropriate epochs. Through this i got pretty Good Accuracy from the model and then finally i saved that model in a .h5 extension file. Then i created one more python file where i load my own created model and using it i predicted some Face photos which showed some wonderful results with good Accuracy
